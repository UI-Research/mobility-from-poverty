The ALSDE does not report withdrawn or dropout students that were identified as homeless which causes the student to be unduplicated. This is the same process that has been used in the past."

The COVID-19 pandemic made it harder to identify children who are homeless, especially those that did not attend school in-person. The pandemic made it that much harder because many students were attending school virtually and school staff were not able to easily assess living situations."

Some UHY moved out of the state as well. The PED has strengthened its training/technical assistance by providing LEAs with funding and best practices related to identifying and supporting UHY in order keep them engaged in their education.
