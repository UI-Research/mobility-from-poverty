The higher-than-average unaccompanied youth numbers could be due to an increased emphasis on unaccompanied youth in liaison training to include guest speakers, unaccompanied youth panels, contracted video products highlighting youth, and other added elements of training to highlight unaccompanied homeless youth. Also, Washington state law now requires building level points of contact in every school building, thus improving identification overall. In addition, Washington recently passed state legislation that provides avenues for non-emergency health care, credit retrieval, state ID cards, and other help for unaccompanied youth which may drive some of the increase in identification as youth seek services."

2021-2022,WISCONSIN,118,655,LEA,"Year to Year comparison: The State reported a change of 35% between the prior year and the current year number of homeless unaccompanied youth.","The COVID-19 pandemic caused most LEAs to conduct virtual learning during the 2020-21 school year. Due to virtual learning homeless liaisons reported it was very difficult to identify students as homeless throughout the year. The 2021-22 school year all schools were back to in-person learning. This increased identification overall of students experincing homelessness, including the identification of UHY."
2021-2022,WISCONSIN,"118,195","655,814","LEA,SCH","Across File Comparison: In 32 LEAs, no homeless enrolled students were reported in FS118/DG655, but homeless enrolled students were reported as chronically absent in FS195/DG814.","The Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction considers a student experiencing homelessness to have that status in the database for the entire year, even if they were able to find housing later in the year. Thus when we report Chronic Absenteeism data, the students may appear as chronically absent in a different district than where they were identifed as experiencing homelessness."
