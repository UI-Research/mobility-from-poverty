## 2024

### 2024-02-13

* The recent file incorrectly included 2018 data for income and employment instead of 2021 data. We resolved the issue. 
* The city-level income data incorrectly included missing values coded as large values. We dropped the missing values to fix the calculation.
* We replaced the .SAS programs for income and employment with .R scripts.
