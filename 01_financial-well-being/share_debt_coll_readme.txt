Share debt in collections is the estimated share of people with a credit bureau record who have any debt in collections. Debt in collections includes past-due credit lines that have been closed and charged-off on the creditorâ€™s books as well as unpaid bills reported to the credit bureaus that the creditor is attempting to collect. For example, credit card accounts enter collections status once they are 180 days past due.

We also calculate 95 percent confidence interval (upper and lower bounds) for the estimate, where we redefine the few negative lower bounds to be equal to zero.
