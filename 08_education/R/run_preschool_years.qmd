## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}

quarto::quarto_render(input = here::here("08_education", "preschool_place_calculate.qmd"), 
                      output_file = "calculate-prek-2016.html",
                      execute_params = list(year = "2016")
                      )

```
