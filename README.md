# Motivation

The objective of this repository is to make all results reproducible, to document processes and assumptions, and to make it easier for analysts to produce metrics in future years. A little extra effort today can make a big difference in the future. For more motivation, please read the motivation for a style guide by  [Michael Stepner](https://github.com/michaelstepner/healthinequality-code/tree/master/code#motivation). If that isn't enough, read the section on [technical debt](https://github.com/michaelstepner/healthinequality-code/blob/master/code/readme.md#technical-debt).

This guide is a work-in-progress. If there are any ambiguities or unresolved questions, please contact [Aaron R. Williams](awilliams@urban.org).

# Repository Contents

todo(aaron): clean up repository contents

# File Description

## Recent File

The recent file has exactly one year per county and contains the most recent year for each of the mobility metrics.

## Multi-Year File

The multi-year file contains one year per county per year. It contains missing values where metrics are unavailable or have not been computed. 

## Variables

todo(aaron): Include a table with variables and informaiton about the variables. 

# Project Organization

* Each metric or *closely* related set of metrics should have its own directory. The name of the directory should only contain lower case letters, numbers, and hyphens. Do not include spaces. 
* Each subdirectory should include a README.md. The README.md should include all information outlined in the README.md for each file created in the subdirectory. It should also contain clear instructions for running the code. Start the `README.md` using `README-template.md`.
* Avoid absolute file paths. If using R, use `.Rproj`. If using Stata, use projects. Otherwise, set the working directory. 
* **Do not add any data to the repository.** Each subfolder should contain a `data/` folder for intermediate and final data files. The `data/` folder should be added to the `.gitignore`. 
* If possible, download your data with code or pull your data from an API with code. 
* **Do not include any credentials in the repository.** Please reach out to [Aaron R. Williams](awilliams@urban.org) if this creates issues. 
* Use names that play well with default ordering (e.g. 01, 02 and YYYY-MM-DD dates) for directory and file names.

# GitHub

## GitHub Standards

* Do not work on the `master` branch. 
* **Do not add any data to the repository.** Each subfolder should contain a `data/` folder for intermediate and final data files. The `data/` folder should be added to the `.gitignore`. 
* Regularly pull from the remote `master` branch to keep your local and remote branches up-to-date. Most merges will automatically resolve. [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line) are tips for resolving other merge conflicts. 
* The use of [GitHub issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues) is encouraged. 

## GitHub Workflow

1. Check out a branch with your first name in lowercase. Additional branching is allowed but merge all changes into your main branch.
2. Commit changes regularly with detailed commit messages. 
3. Regularly push your code to your remote branch on GitHub. 
4. To contribute to the `master` branch, put in a Pull Request. Tag Aaron R. Williams as a reviewer (@awunderground). Briefly describe what the PR does. 
5. Aaron R. Williams will review and incorporate changes into the `master` branch. He may ask you to make changes. 

**Please reach out Aaron with any questions.** The only thing he loves more than version control is helping people learn version control. 

# Data Standards

* All final files should be in the `.csv` format. 
* Do not open and save any `.csv` files in Microsoft Excel. Excel defaults are not sensible and lead to analytical errors. 
* Important intermediate files should be added to Box. Final data files should be added to Box.

### Joining variables

* The first four variables in every file should be `year`, `state`, `county`, and `tract`. `year` should be a four digit numeric variable. `state` should be a two characters FIPS code, `county` should be a three character FIPS code, and `tract` should be a six character FIPS code. All geography variables should have leading zeros for ids beginning in zeros. 

### Values

* Include all counties even if a county is all missing values. Every join to the master file should be one-to-one within a year.
* Variable names should only include lower case letters, numbers, and underscores (lower camel case, i.e. camel_case). 
* Percentages should be stored as proportions between o and 1 inclusive with a leading zero. (75% should be 0.75)
* Missing values should be coded as `NA`

### Sorting

* All files should be sorted by `year`, `state`, `county`, and `tract`, the first four variables in every file. 

# Code Standards 

* The [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) was written for R but contains lots of good language-agnostic suggestions for programming. 
* Use descriptive names for all variables, data sets, functions, and macros. Avoid abbreviations. 
* Include comments that state "why", not "what". Include comments for all assumptions. 
* Don't repeat yourself. If you do anything more than twice, turn it into a function or macro. Document the function or macro. 
* Use ISO 8601 dates (YYYY-MM-DD).
* Write assertions and in-line tests. Assertions, things expected to always be true about the code, should be tested in-line. [healthinequality-code](https://github.com/michaelstepner/healthinequality-code/blob/master/code/readme.md#assert-what-youre-expecting-to-be-true) offers some good background. `assert` is useful in Stata and `stopifnot()` is useful in R. 
* Write tests for final files. Write a test if all numbers should be non-negative. Write a test if values should not exceed $3,000. 
* Write tests for macros and functions to ensure appropriate behavior. 

> Whenever you are tempted to type something into a print statement or a debugger expression, write it as a test instead. â€” Martin Fowler

* The top of each script should clearly label the purpose of the script. Here is an example Stata header:

```
/*************************/
Ancestor Program: [Path to the program including the name of the program]
original data: [Path of where the data live]
Description: [Overall description]
(1)[insert task description here, and then copy & paste this to indicate where that task is later in your program]
(2)
(3) [etc...]
*/
/*************************/

```

# Code Review

## Scope of the review

Code and documentation will be reviewed by Aaron R. Williams and possibly additional reviewers. Aaron's code and documentation will be reviewed by someone else. Code reviews will be handled through GitHub. The scope of the review will involve the following three levels:

1. Reproduction of results. 
    * Code should not error out. Warnings and notes are also cause for concern. 
    * The code should exactly recreate the final result. 
2. A line-by-line review of code logic. 
    * Variable construction: What is the unit of analysis? Is it consistent throughout the dataset?
    * Are new variables what they say they are (check codebooks)?
    * Check whether simple operations like addition/subtraction/division exclude observations with missing data.
    * Does the researcher subset the data at all? Is it done permanently or temporarily?
    * How are missing values coded?
    * Look at merges/joins and appends - do the data appear to be matched appropriately? Are there identical non-ID variables in both datasets? How are non-matching data handled or dropped?
    * Are weights used consistently?
3. Code Architecture/Readability.
    * Is the code DRY (don't repeat yourself)? If code is repeated more than once, recommend that the writer turn the repeated code into a function.
    * Is there a place where a variable is rebuilt or changed later on?
    * Are values transcribed by hand?

## How to Prepare for a Code Review

* Data access should be abundantly clear. Scripts should download the data or instructions for the necessary files located on Box should be included. 
* State if special computation was used (i.e. the Stata server or SAS server). 
* If scripts use many variable names, make sure to include a codebook so reviewers can follow along.
* For calculations, code should be commented with clear variable labels. 

# Creating the Final File

There will be two final files. The first file with be a year-county file with one row per county per year. The second file will be county-level file with only the most recent year of data for each variable. Both files will be [tidy data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) with each variable in its own column, each observation in its own row, and each value in its own cell.
