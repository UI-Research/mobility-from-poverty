# Poverty Exposure

This metric is the share of people who are poor in a county who live in census tracts with poverty rates over 40%. If a county's overall poverty rate is 20% but people in poverty are spread out evenly across all census tracts, the index would equal 0; if they were heavily concentrated in certain tracts, the index would approach 1.

**Process:**

1. Pull people and poverty rates for Census tracts. 
2. Create the “Other Races and Ethnicities” subgroup. 
3. Count the number of people in poverty who live in Census tracts with poverty > 40% in each county. 
4. Summarize the tract data to the county-level.
5. Divide the number from 2. by the total number of people in poverty in each Census tract. 
6. Split the data into an “All” file and a “Subgroups” file
7. Validation
8. Data quality flags

All numbers come for the Census API. The documentation for the Census API is available [here](https://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acs5/profile/variables.html). We pull all of the race/ethnicity counts for 2018 using `library(censusapi)`. **Note:** This will require a [Census API key](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html). Add the key to `census_api_key-template.R` and then delete then delete "template". It is sourced above. 

To do this we have to identify census tracts with poverty rates over 40% in each county, count the number of residents in those tracts who are poor, sum that up and divided it by the total number of poor residents in the county.

state_fips <- paste0("state:", unique(urbnmapr::states$state_fips))

tracts <- map_df(state_fips, ~getCensus(name = "acs/acs5",

    poverty_hispanic_moe = B17001I_002M
  )

```

Some tracts don't have any population. We drop those tracts. 

```{r}
tracts <- tracts %>%
  tidylog::filter(people > 0)

```

There was a data collection error in Rio Arriba County, NM ([source](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/errata/125.html)). We drop these observations. 

```{r}
tracts <- tracts %>%
  tidylog::filter(state != "35" | county != "039")

```

Check the number of people. It should be around [314,943,184](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=B17001&tid=ACSDT5Y2018.B17001&hidePreview=false).

```{r check-total-population}
tracts %>%
  summarize(sum(people))

```

### 2. Create the “Other Races and Ethnicities” subgroup

We need to combine the small groups into a group for other races and ethnicities. The Census Bureau typically only posts cross tabs for up to two variables. This requires race, ethnicity, and poverty status so the resulting groups are not disjoint.  

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("06_neighborhoods", "www", "images", "race.png"))

```

Combine the race/ethnicity groups into the group of interest. 

```{r}
tracts <- tracts %>%
  mutate(
    poverty_other_races = 
      poverty_aian +
      poverty_asian +
      poverty_pacific + 
      poverty_other +
      poverty_twoplus
  ) #%>%
  #select(-poverty_aian, -poverty_asian, -poverty_pacific, -poverty_other, -poverty_twoplus)

```

[This Census presentation](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/training-presentations/20180418_MOE_Webinar_Transcript.pdf) recommends using the maximum margin of error when aggregating multiple zero estimates.

> One way this approximation can differ from the actual MOE is if you were aggregating multiple zero estimates. In this case, the approximate MOE could diverge from the actual margin of error. And so the - our recommendation is to only include one zero estimate margin of error and include the largest one. 

```{r}
# pivot the point estimates
values <- tracts %>%
  select(state, 
         county, 
         tract, 
         poverty_aian,
         poverty_asian,
         poverty_pacific, 
         poverty_other,
         poverty_twoplus) %>%
  pivot_longer(c(-state, -county, -tract), names_to = "group", values_to = "value")

# pivot the margins of error
moes <- tracts %>%
  select(state, 
         county, 
         tract, 
         poverty_aian_moe,
         poverty_asian_moe,
         poverty_pacific_moe, 
         poverty_other_moe,
         poverty_twoplus_moe) %>%
  pivot_longer(c(-state, -county, -tract), names_to = "group", values_to = "moe") %>%
  mutate(group = str_replace(group, "_moe", ""))

# combine the point estimates and margins of error
other_moe <- left_join(values, moes, by = c("state", "county", "tract", "group"))
    
rm(moes, values)

# keep MOE for non-zero estimates and keep the largest MOE for zero estimates
other_moe <- other_moe %>%
  group_by(state, county, tract) %>%
  mutate(moe_rank = row_number(desc(moe))) %>%
  mutate(moe_rank = if_else(value == 0, moe_rank, 5L)) %>%
  mutate(moe_rank = ifelse(moe_rank == min(moe_rank), moe_rank, 0L)) %>%
  filter(value != 0 | moe_rank != 0) %>%
  select(-moe_rank) 

# combine the margins of error
other_moe <- other_moe %>%
  summarize(poverty_other_races_moe = sqrt(sum(moe ^ 2))) %>%
  ungroup()

# append to the original data set
tracts <- left_join(tracts, other_moe, by = c("state", "county", "tract"))

tracts <- tracts %>%
  select(state, 
         county, 
         tract, 
         people, 
         poverty,
         poverty_black, 
         poverty_hispanic, 
         poverty_other_races, 
         poverty_white_nonhispanic, 
         poverty_moe,
         poverty_black_moe, 
         poverty_hispanic_moe, 
         poverty_other_races_moe, 
         poverty_white_nonhispanic_moe) 

```

Look at the margins of error. A large share of the Other Races and Ethnicities have coefficients of variation greater than 0.4.

```{r}
tracts %>%
  summarize(mean(poverty_other_races_moe / poverty_other_races > 0.4))

```

```{r}
tracts %>%
  ggplot(aes(poverty_black, poverty_black_moe)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1, size = 0.5) +
  geom_abline(aes(slope = 0.4, intercept = 0)) +  
  labs(title = "Most Black Estimates Have Large MOE",
       subtitle = "Line represents a CV of 0.4") +  
  coord_equal() +
  scatter_grid()

tracts %>%
  ggplot(aes(poverty_hispanic, poverty_hispanic_moe)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1, size = 0.5) +
  geom_abline(aes(slope = 0.4, intercept = 0)) +
  labs(title = "Most Hispanic Estimates Have Large MOE",
       subtitle = "Line represents a CV of 0.4") +
  coord_equal() +
  scatter_grid()

tracts %>%
  ggplot(aes(poverty_other_races, poverty_other_races_moe)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1, size = 0.5) +
  geom_abline(aes(slope = 0.4, intercept = 0)) +  
    labs(title = "Most Other Races and Ethnicities Estimates Have Large MOE",
       subtitle = "Line represents a CV of 0.4") +
  coord_equal() +
  scatter_grid()

tracts %>%
  ggplot(aes(poverty_white_nonhispanic, poverty_white_nonhispanic_moe)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1, size = 0.5) +
  geom_abline(aes(slope = 0.4, intercept = 0)) +  
  labs(title = "Most White, non-Hispanic Estimates Have Large MOE",
       subtitle = "Line represents a CV of 0.4") +  
  coord_equal() +
  scatter_grid()

```



```{r}
tracts %>%
  mutate(poverty_summed = poverty_black + poverty_hispanic + poverty_other_races + poverty_white_nonhispanic) %>%
  ggplot(aes(poverty, poverty_summed)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2, size = 1) +
  coord_equal() +
  labs(title = "The Counts Are Unequal because the Groups Aren't Disjoint") +
  scatter_grid()

```

### 3. Count the number of people in poverty who live in Census tracts with poverty > 40% in each county. 

We turn the count of people in poverty into a rate. 

```{r}
tracts <- tracts %>%
  mutate(poverty_rate = poverty / people)

stopifnot(min(tracts$poverty_rate) >= 0)
stopifnot(max(tracts$poverty_rate) <= 1)

```

We calculate the rate of poverty in high-poverty tracts.

```{r count-high-poverty}
tracts <- tracts %>%
  mutate(
    high_poverty = if_else(poverty_rate > 0.4, poverty, 0),
    high_poverty_black = if_else(poverty_rate > 0.4, poverty_black, 0),
    high_poverty_hispanic = if_else(poverty_rate > 0.4, poverty_hispanic, 0),
    high_poverty_other_races = if_else(poverty_rate > 0.4, poverty_other_races, 0),
    high_poverty_white_nonhispanic = if_else(poverty_rate > 0.4, poverty_white_nonhispanic, 0)
  )

```

### 4. Summarize the tract data to the county-level

We calculate the overall poverty and the number of people without a poverty estimate and then sum to the county level. 

```{r}
counties_summary <- tracts %>%
  group_by(state, county) %>%
  summarize(
    people = sum(people), 
    tracts = n(),
    # poverty
    poverty = sum(poverty), 
    poverty_black = sum(poverty_black),
    poverty_hispanic = sum(poverty_hispanic),
    poverty_other_races = sum(poverty_other_races),
    poverty_white_nonhispanic = sum(poverty_white_nonhispanic),
    # high poverty
    high_poverty = sum(high_poverty),
    high_poverty_black = sum(high_poverty_black),
    high_poverty_hispanic = sum(high_poverty_hispanic),
    high_poverty_other_races = sum(high_poverty_other_races),
    high_poverty_white_nonhispanic = sum(high_poverty_white_nonhispanic),
    # MOE
    poverty_moe = sqrt(sum(poverty_moe ^ 2)),
    poverty_black_moe = sqrt(sum(poverty_black_moe ^ 2)),
    poverty_hispanic_moe = sqrt(sum(poverty_hispanic_moe ^ 2)),
    poverty_other_races_moe = sqrt(sum(poverty_other_races_moe ^ 2)),
    poverty_white_nonhispanic_moe = sqrt(sum(poverty_white_nonhispanic_moe ^ 2))
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

counties_summary <- counties_summary %>%
  mutate(poverty_rate = poverty / people)

```

We pull in the county-level data and compare it to the calculated county-level data. The poverty rates should be identical; however, they may differ from numbers published elsewhere (like [here](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/autaugacountyalabama)) that use Small-Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE). 

```{r}
counties_test <- map_df(state_fips, ~getCensus(name = "acs/acs5",
                                               vars = vars, 
                                               region = "county:*",
                                               regionin = .x,
                                               vintage = 2018)) %>%
  as_tibble()

counties_test <- counties_test %>%
  mutate(poverty_rate_test = B17001_002E / B17001_001E) %>%
  select(state, county, poverty_rate_test) %>%
  arrange(state, county)

stopifnot(
  counties_summary %>%
    select(state, county, poverty_rate) %>%
    left_join(counties_test, by = c("state", "county")) %>%
    filter(poverty_rate != poverty_rate_test) %>%
    nrow() == 0
)

rm(counties_test)

```

### 5. Divide high poverty by total poverty

We need the conditional logic to deal with division by zero. If there is no poverty then poverty exposure is zero. 

```{r calculate-poverty-exposure}
counties_summary <- counties_summary %>%
  mutate(
    poverty_exposure = high_poverty / poverty,
    poverty_exposure_black = 
      if_else(condition = poverty_black > 0, 
              true = high_poverty_black / poverty_black, 
              false = 0),
    poverty_exposure_hispanic = 
      if_else(condition = poverty_hispanic > 0, 
              true = high_poverty_hispanic / poverty_hispanic, 
              false = 0),
    poverty_exposure_other_races = 
      if_else(condition = poverty_other_races > 0, 
              true = high_poverty_other_races / poverty_other_races, 
              false = 0),
    poverty_exposure_white_nonhispanic = 
      if_else(condition = poverty_white_nonhispanic > 0, 
              true = high_poverty_white_nonhispanic / poverty_white_nonhispanic,  
              false = 0),
  ) 

stopifnot(
  all(map_dbl(counties_summary, ~sum(is.na(.x))) == 0)
)

```

Let's look at the highest values. 

```{r}
counties_summary %>%
  arrange(desc(poverty_exposure)) %>%
  select(state, county, poverty_exposure)

```

There shouldn't be any missing values. 

```{r}
stopifnot(
  counties_summary %>%
    filter(is.na(poverty_exposure)) %>%
    nrow() == 0
)

```

### 6. Split the data into an “All” file and a “Subgroups” file

```{r}
# create a long version of the subgroup data
counties_summary_subgroups <- counties_summary %>%
  select(state, county, contains("exposure")) %>%
  pivot_longer(c(-state, -county), names_to = "subgroup", values_to = "poverty_exposure") %>%
  mutate(subgroup = 
           recode(
             subgroup,
             poverty_exposure = "All",
             poverty_exposure_black = "Black, Non-Hispanic",
             poverty_exposure_hispanic = "Hispanic",
             poverty_exposure_other_races = "Other Races and Ethnicities", 
             poverty_exposure_white_nonhispanic = "White, Non-Hispanic"
           )
  )

# check the bounds of the poverty exposure metric
stopifnot(min(counties_summary_subgroups$poverty_exposure) >= 0)
stopifnot(max(counties_summary_subgroups$poverty_exposure) <= 1)

```

### 7. Quality Flags

```{r}

#' Suppress counties
#'
#' @param race The variable for the count in a race/ethnicity group
#' @param exposure The variable name for the exposure index
#' @param threshold The minimum size of the race group to report the exposure index
#'
#' @return
#'
suppress_county <- function(race, exposure, threshold) {
  
  exposure <- if_else(race <= threshold, as.numeric(NA), exposure)
  return(exposure)
  
}

counties_summary %>%
  summarize(
    all = sum(is.na(poverty_exposure)),
    black_nh = sum(is.na(poverty_exposure_black)),
    hispanic = sum(is.na(poverty_exposure_hispanic)),
    other_nh = sum(is.na(poverty_exposure_other_races)),
    white_nh = sum(is.na(poverty_exposure_white_nonhispanic))
  )

counties_summary <- counties_summary %>%
  mutate(
    poverty_exposure = suppress_county(race = poverty, exposure = poverty_exposure, threshold = 30),
    poverty_exposure_black = suppress_county(race = poverty_black, exposure = poverty_exposure_black, threshold = 30),
    poverty_exposure_hispanic = suppress_county(race = poverty_hispanic, exposure = poverty_exposure_hispanic, threshold = 30),

    other_nh = sum(is.na(poverty_exposure_other_races)),
    white_nh = sum(is.na(poverty_exposure_white_nonhispanic))
  )

```



















We need to add data quality flags with `1`, `2`, or `3`. The values are outlined in the [data standards](https://github.com/UI-Research/gates-mobility-metrics). 

* `1` - If the county coefficient of variation for the count in the group is less than 0.2
* `2` - If the county coefficient of variation for the count in the group is less than 0.4
* `3` - If the county coefficient of variation for the count in the group exceeds 0.4
* `NA` - If the metric is missing

```{r}
counties_summary <- counties_summary %>%
  mutate(
    poverty_cv = poverty_moe / poverty,
    poverty_black_cv = poverty_black_moe / poverty_black,
    poverty_hispanic_cv = poverty_hispanic_moe / poverty_hispanic, 
    poverty_other_races_cv = poverty_other_races_moe / poverty_other_races,
    poverty_white_nonhispanic_cv = poverty_white_nonhispanic_moe / poverty_white_nonhispanic
  )

```{r}
#' Assign a data quality flag
#'
#' @param race A vector of counts of a race/ethnicity group within a county
#' @param exposure A race/ethnicity exposure metric
#'
#' @return A numeric data quality flag
#'
set_quality <- function(cv, exposure) {
  
  quality <- case_when(
    cv < 0.2 ~ 1,

    cv >= 0.4 ~ 3
  )
  quality <- if_else(is.na(exposure), as.numeric(NA), quality)
  
  return(quality)

count(counties_summary, poverty_exposure_hispanic_quality)
count(counties_summary, poverty_exposure_other_races_quality)
count(counties_summary, poverty_exposure_white_nonhispanic_quality)

```

Most of the counties with missing values are very small. 

```{r}
missing <- counties_summary %>%
  filter(
    is.na(poverty_exposure) |
      is.na(poverty_exposure_black) |
      is.na(poverty_exposure_hispanic) |
      is.na(poverty_exposure_other_races) |
      is.na(poverty_exposure_white_nonhispanic)
    )

max(missing$people)
max(missing$tracts)

```

### 8. Save the data

#### All File

We need to include all counties in the published data even if we don't have a metric for the county. We load the county file and join our metrics to the county file. 

```{r save-data}
# load the 2018 county file
all_counties <- read_csv(here::here("geographic-crosswalks", "data", "county-file.csv")) %>%
  filter(year == 2018)

final_data <- left_join(all_counties, counties_summary, by = c("state", "county")) %>%
  select(year,
         state,
         county,
         poverty_exposure)

write_csv(final_data,
          here::here("06_neighborhoods", "poverty-exposure", "poverty-exposure.csv"))

```

#### Subgroup File

```{r}
counties_summary_subgroups <- counties_summary_subgroups %>%
  mutate(subgroup_type = if_else(subgroup == "All", "all", "race-ethnicity"))

final_data_race_ethnicity <- left_join(all_counties, counties_summary_subgroups, by = c("state", "county")) %>%
  select(year,
         state,
         county,
         subgroup_type,
         subgroup,
         poverty_exposure)

write_csv(final_data_race_ethnicity,
          here::here("06_neighborhoods", "poverty-exposure", "poverty-exposure_race-ethnicity.csv"))

```
