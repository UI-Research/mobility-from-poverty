# Transit Cost and Transit Trips Index

The Low Transportation Cost Index and Transit Trips Index are both calculated "for a 3-person single-parent family with income at 50% of the median income for renters in the region (ie CBSA)." They are available in the HUD AFFH dataset at the tract level. Both indexes are values on a scale from 0 - 100 and ranked nationally. For transit cost, higher index values means lower cost; for transit trips, higher index values means greater likelihood residents use transit.
