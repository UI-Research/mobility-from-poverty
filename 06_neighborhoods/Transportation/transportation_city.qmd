## Setup

### Load Packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

source(here("functions", "testing", "evaluate_final_data.R"))

theme_set(theme_minimal())

```

### Read data

The data from HUD cannot be easily read directly into this program.
Before running, please download the entirety of the folders listed below from the following [Box
folder](https://urbanorg.app.box.com/folder/250262697073) into the
repository folder. You may be required to unzip the folders but keep the raw files in their folders. 
`"mobility-from-poverty\06_neighborhoods\Transportation\data"`

-   2015_tract
-   2019_tract

Import all the files (and/or combine into one file) with only the
relevant variables and years

```{r}
tractpath15 <- list.files(
  path = here("06_neighborhoods",
              "Transportation", 
              "data", 
              "2015_tract"), 
  pattern = "*.csv", 
  full.names = TRUE
)

tractpath19 <- list.files(
  path = here("06_neighborhoods",
              "Transportation", 
              "data", 
              "2019_tract"), 
  pattern = "*.csv", 
  full.names = TRUE
)

transportation_tracts <- bind_rows(
  `2015` = map_df(tractpath15, read_csv),
  `2019` = map_df(tractpath19, read_csv),
  .id = "year"
) |>
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))

```

## Clean Data

Create correct FIPS columns.

```{r}
transportation_tracts <- transportation_tracts |>
  rename (GEOID = tract) |>
  mutate(
    state = substr(GEOID, start = 2, stop = 3),
    county = substr(GEOID, start = 4, stop = 6),
    tract = substr(GEOID, start = 7, stop = 12)
  )

transportation_tracts <- transportation_tracts |>
  select(
    year, GEOID, state, county, tract, blkgrps, population, households, 
    count_transit_trips = transit_trips_80ami, 
    index_transportation_cost = t_80ami
  )

```

Many tracts have no households. We drop these tracts.

```{r}
transportation_tracts <- transportation_tracts |>
  filter(households > 0)

```

## Crosswalk to Cities

Bring in the crosswalk of interest (we want the year range to be before 2020, when tract definitions changed)

```{r}
tract_place <- read_csv(
  here::here("geographic-crosswalks", "data", "tract-place-crosswalk_2020.csv"),
  skip = 1
) %>%
  select(
    state = `State code`, 
    county = `County code`, 
    place = `Place code`, 
    tract = Tract, 
    afact = `tract-to-place allocation factor`,
    afact2 = `place-to-tract allocation factor`
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    county = substring(county, 3, 5),
    state_place = str_c(state, place),
    tract = str_remove(string = tract, pattern = "[.]")
  )

```

Limit to the Census Places we want.

```{r}
places <- read_csv(here("geographic-crosswalks", 
                        "data", 
                        "place-populations.csv"))
```

Filter the crosswalk to only include the places in the place destination file. 

```{r}
# tract_place <- tract_place |>
#   filter(paste0(state, place) %in% paste0(places$state, places$place))

```

## Join and Aggregate

The CNT data contains tracts not included in our places. Our places include tracts not included in the CNT data. 

```{r}
anti_join(
  transportation_tracts, 
  tract_place, 
  by = c("state", "county", "tract")
)

anti_join(
  tract_place,
  transportation_tracts, 
  by = c("state", "county", "tract")
)

```

```{r}
transportation_tracts_places <- left_join(
  transportation_tracts, 
  tract_place, 
  by = c("state", "county", "tract")
)

transportation_tracts_places <- transportation_tracts_places |>
  filter(!is.na(place))

```

Collapse to places and also create data quality marker data quality can be 1 when most of the tracts that fall in the place (e.g., >50% of the tracts) have most of their area falling in the place (e.g., >50% of the tract's area is in the place) otherwise, data quality is 2

```{r}
transportation_places <- transportation_tracts_places |> 
  dplyr::group_by(year, state, place) |> 
  dplyr::summarize(
    n = n(),
    count_transit_trips = weighted.mean(count_transit_trips, w = households * afact, na.rm = TRUE),
    index_transportation_cost = weighted.mean(index_transportation_cost, w = households * afact, na.rm = TRUE),
    match_pop = sum(population * afact),
    match_quality = weighted.mean(afact > 0.5, weight = households, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |>
  ungroup() |>
  dplyr::mutate(
    index_transportation_cost_quality = case_when(
      match_quality >= 0.5 ~ 1,
      match_quality < 0.5 ~ 2,
      TRUE ~ NA
    )
  ) |>
  mutate(count_transit_trips_quality = index_transportation_cost_quality)
  
```

Left join with places file to get rid of irrelevant places data

```{r}
transportation_city <- left_join(
  places, 
  transportation_places, 
  by = c("year", "state", "place")
) |>
  filter(year %in% c(2015, 2019))

transportation_city |>
  ggplot(aes(population, match_pop)) +
  geom_abline(color = "red") +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  labs(
    title = "Points on the line suggest high-quality"
  )

```

```{r}
map_dbl(transportation_city, ~sum(is.na(.x)))

```

## Transit Trips Quality Control Checks

### Missing Data

```{r}
transportation_city |>
  filter(is.na(count_transit_trips))

```

Loving County, Texas is missing in 2015. 

### Distribution

Use stopifnot to check if all values in `transportation_city` are non-negative.

```{r}
stopifnot(min(transportation_city$count_transit_trips, na.rm = TRUE) >= 0)
```

Create a histogram plot and summary stats for each dataframe check that
all values are non-negative & count missing values examine outliers.

```{r}
ggplot(transportation_city, aes(x = count_transit_trips)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) + 
  facet_wrap(~ year, nrow = 2) +
  labs(
    x = "Annual Transit Trips for the Regional Moderate Income Household", 
    y = "number of counties"
  )
```

Makes sense for most counties to fall in really low transit trip numbers
since most of the US has no public infrastructure that can be used for
daily transport

Look at summary stats

```{r}
summary(transportation_city$count_transit_trips)
```

Examine extreme values

```{r}
transportation_city |>
  group_by(year) |>
  slice_max(n = 10, order_by = count_transit_trips)

```

### Change

```{r}
transportation_city |>
  select(state, place, year, population, count_transit_trips) |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = year, 
    values_from = c(population, count_transit_trips)
  ) |>
  mutate(size = if_else(population_2019 > 400000, "Large cities", "Small cities")) |>
  ggplot(aes(count_transit_trips_2015, count_transit_trips_2019, size = population_2019)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  facet_wrap(~ size) +
  coord_equal() +
  labs(subtitle = "Large counties have at least 400,000 people")


transportation_city |>
  group_by(state, place) |>
  mutate(change = count_transit_trips - lag(count_transit_trips)) |>
  ungroup() |>
  filter(year == 2019) |>
  slice_max(order_by = abs(change), n = 10)

```

## Cost Quality Control Checks

### Missing Data

```{r}
transportation_city |>
  filter(is.na(index_transportation_cost))

```

Loving County, Texas is missing in 2015. 

### Distribution

Use stopifnot to check if all values in `transportation_city` are
non-negative

```{r}
stopifnot(min(transportation_city$index_transportation_cost, na.rm = TRUE) >= 0)
```

Create a histogram plot and summary stats for each dataframe check that
all values are non-negative & count missing values examine outliers.

```{r}
ggplot(transportation_city, aes(x = index_transportation_cost)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) + 
  facet_wrap(~ year, nrow = 2) +
  labs(
    x = "Annual Transportation Costs for the Regional Moderate Income Household", 
    y = "number of counties"
  )

```

Makes sense for most counties to fall in really low transit trip numbers
since most of the US has no public infrastructure that can be used for
daily transport

Look at summary stats

```{r}
summary(transportation_city$index_transportation_cost)
```

Examine extreme values

```{r}
transportation_city |>
  group_by(year) |>
  slice_max(n = 10, order_by = index_transportation_cost)

```

### Change

```{r}
transportation_city |>
  select(state, place, year, population, index_transportation_cost) |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = year, 
    values_from = c(population, index_transportation_cost)
  ) |>
  mutate(size = if_else(population_2019 > 400000, "Large cities", "Small cities")) |>
  ggplot(aes(index_transportation_cost_2015, index_transportation_cost_2019, size = population_2019)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  facet_wrap(~ size) +
  coord_equal() +
  labs(subtitle = "Large counties have at least 400,000 people")


transportation_city |>
  group_by(state, place) |>
  mutate(change = index_transportation_cost - lag(index_transportation_cost)) |>
  ungroup() |>
  filter(year == 2019) |>
  slice_max(order_by = abs(change), n = 10)
```

## Data Quality Marker

Data quality is calculated above using the match quality. 

## Export final files

Keep variables of interest and order them appropriately.

```{r}
final_data <- transportation_city |>
  select(
    year, state, place, count_transit_trips, count_transit_trips_quality,
    index_transportation_cost, index_transportation_cost_quality
  ) |>
  arrange(year, state, place)

```

Run the evaluation function. 

```{r}
evaluate_final_data(
  exp_form_path = here("06_neighborhoods", 
       "Transportation", 
       "final", 
       "final_data_evaluation_form.csv"), 
  data = final_data, 
  geography = "place", 
  confidence_intervals = FALSE
)

```

Write the final data.

```{r}
final_data |>
  write_csv(
    here("06_neighborhoods", 
         "Transportation", 
         "final", 
         "transportation_all_city.csv")
  )

```
